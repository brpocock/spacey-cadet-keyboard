spacey-cadet-keyboard
=====================

I use a keymap that's a fun mix of different less-painful keyboard
layout options and mappings of some editing keys and symbols that I find
to be particularly useful.

It's originally biased toward the design of the Space Cadet keyboard,
thus the nickname.
